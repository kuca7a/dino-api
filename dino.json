    "meaning": "Earth claw",
    "type": "Prosauropod",
    "length": "8.0m",
    "diet": "Herbivorous",
    "period": "Early Jurassic, 199-198 million years ago",
    "found": "South Africa",
    "description": "Aardonyx is known from 2 immature individuals. Adults would have been much larger, probably over 10m. Aardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on 2 legs) but also capable of walking on all 4 legs. This and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later."
